### Part 0. Google Colab Setup

Welcome to the first full programming project for CS 4650! If you're new to Google Colab we recommend looking at [this](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb) intro notebook before getting started with this project. In short, Colab is a Jupyter notebook environment that runs in the cloud, it's recommended for all of the programming projects in this course due to its availability, ease of use, and hardware accessibility. Some features that you may find especially useful are on the left hand side, these being:

*   Table of contents: displays the sections of the notebook made using text cells
*   Variables: useful for debugging and see current values of variables
*   Files: useful or uploading or downloading any files you upload to Colab or write while working on the projects



**To begin this project, make a copy of this notebook and save it to your local drive so that you can edit it.**


If you want GPU's (which will improve training times), you can always change your instance type to GPU by going to Runtime -> Change runtime type -> Hardware accelerator.

If you're new to PyTorch, or simply want a refresher, we recommend you start by looking through these [Introduction to PyTorch](https://cocoxu.github.io/CS4650_spring2022/slides/PyTorch_tutorial.pdf) slides and this interactive [PyTorch Basics notebook](http://bit.ly/pytorchbasics). Additionally, this [Text Sentiment](http://bit.ly/pytorchexample) notebook will provide some insight into working with PyTorch for NLP specific problems.

Now that we've loaded this dataset, we need to split the data into train, validation, and test sets. A good explanation of why we need these different sets can be found in subsection 2.2.5 of [Eisenstein](https://github.com/jacobeisenstein/gt-nlp-class/blob/master/notes/eisenstein-nlp-notes.pdf) but at the end it comes down to having a trustworthy and generalized model. The validation (sometimes called a development or tuning) set is used to help choose hyperparameters for our model, whereas the training set is used to fit the learned parameters (weights and biases) to the task. The test set is used to provide a final unbiased evaluation of our trained model, hopefully providing some insight into how it would actually do in production. Each of these sets should be disjoint from the others, to prevent any "peeking" that could unfairly influence our understanding of the model's accuracy. 

In addition to these different sets of data, we also need to create a vocab map for words in our Onion dataset, which will map tokens to numbers. This will be useful later, since torch PyTorch use tensors of sequences of numbers as inputs. **Go to the following cell, and fill out split_train_val_test and generate_vocab_map.**

"""### Part 2: Modeling [10 pts]
Let's move to modeling, now that we have dataset iterators that batch our data for us. In the following code block, you'll build a feed-forward neural network implementing a neural bag-of-words baseline, NBOW-RAND, described in section 2.1 of [this paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P15-1162.pdf). You'll find [this](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html) page useful for understanding the different layers and [this](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nlp/sequence_models_tutorial.html) page useful for how to put them into action.

The core idea behind this baseline is that after we embed each word for a document, we average the embeddings to produce a single vector that hopefully captures some general information spread across the sequence of embeddings. This means we first turn each document of length *n* into a matrix of *nxd*, where *d* is the dimension of the embedding. Then we average this matrix to produce a vector of length *d*, summarizing the contents of the document and proceed with the rest of the network. 

While you're working through this implementation, keep in mind how the dimensions change and what each axes represents, as documents will be passed in as minibatches requiring careful selection of which axes you apply certain operations too. You're more than welcome to experiment with the architecture of this network as well outside of the basic setup we describe below, such as adding in other layers, to see how this changes your results.

"""#### Part 2.2 Initialize the NBOW classification model

Since the NBOW model is rather basic, assuming you haven't added any additional layers, there's really only one hyperparameter for the model architecture: the size of the embedding dimension. 

The vocab_size parameter here is based on the number of unique words kept in the vocab after removing those occurring too infrequently, so this is determined by our dataset and is in turn not a true hyperparameter (though the cutoff we used previously might be). The embedding_dim parameter dictates what size vector each word can be embedded as. 

If you added additional linear layers to the NBOW model then the input/output dimensions of each would be considered a hyperparameter you might want to experiment with. While the sizes are constrained based on previous & following layers (the number of dimensions need to match for the matrix multiplication), whatever sequence you used could still be tweaked in various ways. 

A special note concerning the model initialization: We're specifically sending the model to the device set in Part 1, to speed up training if the GPU is available. **Be aware**, you'll have to ensure other tensors are on the same device inside your training and validation loops.

Answer the following questions:

#### 1. What happens to the vocab size as you change the cutoff in the cell below? Can you explain this in the context of [Zipf's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law)?

Answer: As we increase the value of cutoff the vocab_map length is smaller. Zipf's law states that the frequency of a word is inversely proportional to its rank. In other words, we can interpret it as the idea that a small set of frequently used words in every day langauge appears very frequently in the vocab, and a larger set of less common words appears rarely. When we are increasing the cutoff, we are asking to include in the vocabulary only words that appear at least "cutoff" times, which means, as suggested by Zipf's law, that we risk to include in the vocabulary only common words with a high frequency and leave out less common words that might contain important pieces of information for the model to learn.
"""

tmp_vocab, _ = generate_vocab_map(train_df, cutoff = 10)

"""#### 2. Can you describe what cases the model is getting wrong in the witheld test-set? 

Answer: In the following loop, we return the list of tokens for each misclassified article. After printing the sequences, we can notice that the model tends to misclassify an observation when the sequence contains either a lot of UNK values or padding values (that is, when in the tokenized sequence we inserted the padding value to create the batch tensor, whose length was the maximum length of all the headlines in the batch). The model, then, probably finds it more difficult to analyze those observations, as it might interpret them as missing values. For example, let's take the second printed sequence below: ```
['physicists', 'host', 'kavanaugh', 'airport', 'clear','second', 'it','begins', 'francis', 'north','pet','eyeballs','annual','but','','','','','','','', '','','','','','','','','','','']```, after some initial tokens, the sequence presents 18 padding values, which might lead the model to misclassify it.

To do this, you'll need to create a new val_train_loop (``val_train_loop_incorrect``) so it returns incorrect sequences **and** you'll need to decode these sequences back into words. 
Thankfully, you've already created a map that can convert encoded sequences back to regular English: you will find the ``reverse_vocab`` variable useful.

```
# i.e. using a reversed map of {"hi": 2, "hello": 3, "UNK": 0}
# we can turn [2, 3, 0] into this => ["hi", "hello", "UNK"]
```

"""### Part 6: LSTM Model [Extra-Credit, 4 points]

#### Part 6.1 Define the RecurrentModel class
Something that has been overlooked so far in this project is the sequential structure to language: a word typically only has a clear meaning because of its relationship to the words before and after it in the sequence, and the feed-forward network of Part 2 cannot model this type of data. A solution to this, is the use of [recurrent neural networks](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/). These types of networks not only produce some output given some step from a sequence, but also update their internal state, hopefully "remembering" some information about the previous steps in the input sequence. Of course, they do have their own faults, but we'll cover this more thoroughly later in the semester. 

Your task for the extra credit portion of this assignment, is to implement such a model below using a LSTM. Instead of averaging the embeddings as with the FFN in Part 2, you'll instead feed all of these embeddings to a LSTM layer, get its final output, and use this to make your prediction for the class of the headline.
